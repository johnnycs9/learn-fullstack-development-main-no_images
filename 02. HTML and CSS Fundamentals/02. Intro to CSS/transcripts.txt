Speaker

Okay, now you are going to learn about centering elements in CSS. And that is he.

Speaker

scary topic for a lot of developers. So scary that this stack overflow question about how

Speaker

Up to horizontally centered an element has been viewed 4.5 billion times.

Speaker

So if you think this is a little bit confusing, you are in very good company.

Speaker

Don't worry about it.

Speaker

So with that in mind, let's move over to our example.

Speaker

You are going to center this dinosaur pool.

Speaker

As you can see in the CSS.

Speaker

It has just one property set at this point.

Speaker

of more space than we have available.

Speaker

and setting the wither at is actually an important thing in order to center it.

Speaker

because there are some

Speaker

things that need to be in place when we are to send your elements.

Speaker

with the technique you are about to learn.

Speaker

a centering with margins. And these three components are first, the element needs to be displayed blocked. Because how is an element supposed to center itself if it doesn't command full control over all the horizontal space?

Speaker

If it's displayed in line and allows other elements to stack themselves besides the element, well, then it won't be able to center itself because that space now is busy with other things.

Speaker

So in order to center this pool,

Speaker

It needs to control.

Speaker

All the horizontal space.

Speaker

So it needs this.

Speaker

Now, that didn't change anything.

Speaker

But under the hood.

Speaker

the poor now controls the full horizontal space.

Speaker

Okay, the second part is that it must have a width.

Speaker

And that is what we've done here already, because...

Speaker

How is this item supposed to be centered inside the browser if it is wider than the browser itself? That's often what happens with either large elements or with some HTML elements who just naturally actually expand to take up all the available space in the block.

Speaker

So we have to make sure that our element has a width.

Speaker

And finally...

Speaker

We set the margin on the left hand side and the right hand side to the value

Speaker

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Speaker

all the way to the right hand side.

Speaker

Auto here means take up

Speaker

all the available space. And since this is a block element,

Speaker

The available space is all the space that's left after the pool has taken up its 200 pixels.

Speaker

So just ate up all of this space and turned it into margin.

Speaker

However, at this point, margin right enters the party.

Speaker

And just...

Speaker

I won't be available space as well.

Speaker

And at that point, the margin left and margin right goes into a discussion and decides, "Well...

Speaker

Actually, there are two of us here pushing on each of the sides of the element.

Speaker

trying to get all of the available white space.

Speaker

Let's just divide it evenly amongst both of us.

Speaker

And result? Well, it is that the item is centered.

Speaker

So that was a long explanation of centering with margins.

Speaker

you feel confused, don't worry about it right now. All you need to do is remember these three conditions and just be aware of the 4.5 million other developers who are in or have been in the same boat as you. Let's move on to the next scrim.

Mic

That's an important one.

Speaker

Okay, we are back at our Google project. Now your challenge is to center the logo and the search field using the technique you just learned.

Speaker

So go ahead and give that a shot right now.

Speaker

And then I will, of course, show you the solution afterwards as well.

Mic

That's weird.

Mic

you would think that the day

Mic

- Live.

Speaker

as you hopefully remembered.

Speaker

the way to center an element, which is display block and has a width.

Speaker

is by adding margin list auto and margin right auto. So let's do that.

Speaker

As you can see, that pushes the logo all the way to the right hand side because the margin left is set to auto and it takes up as much space as it can.

Speaker

We'll do the same thing with the right hand side. Good Martin. Right.

Speaker

Then, the right hand side starts pushing back again, and when they're both taking up each

Speaker

equally as much space.

Speaker

The margin left and margin right kind of decides, yeah, let's not argue anymore. Now we have a nice balance and whoa, low and behold, our element is centered.

Speaker

Now what we can do is be super lazy and copy that code.

Speaker

and paste it in down here and boom.

Speaker

our input field is centered as well.

Speaker

And our project is starting to look a little bit like our finished design. So this is super cool. Let's just keep up the pace and move on.

Speaker

We need to take a little step back and learn a new CSS concept.

Speaker

Which is the...

Speaker

relative of

Speaker

margins.

Speaker

Pudding.

Speaker

And, of course, going to learn that.

Speaker

through the lens of an example.

Speaker

So here I have

Speaker

Just a simple div.

Speaker

Which contains?

Speaker

a little bit of text, or specifically the two first sentences in the white paper behind Bitcoin.

Speaker

And let's say we want to turn this into a nice-looking card that people can read.

Speaker

If so, we'd probably create a class, can call it Card?

Speaker

And then of course in the style.css, we'd select that card and apply the styling. As for now, it just has one property set, which is the color.

Speaker

that we've said to a shade of black, that isn't...

Speaker

You're black.

Speaker

a little bit softer, so to speak? That is because...

Speaker

By default.

Speaker

And you browse your users pure black as the text color and pure white as the background color. And as a rule of thumb, you never want to have.

Speaker

pure black on pure white.

Speaker

That's not a pleasant experience for the ice.

Speaker

that was a diversion, let's move on with turning this into a nice looking card.

Speaker

So what Card needs a background color, so let's just...

Speaker

You're back, wrong.

Speaker

Gray, for example, like that.

Speaker

And we also don't want our card to be full with, because as you remember, divs are blocked by default and take up the full with.

Speaker

if you don't specify anywhere on it.

Speaker

We're gonna do with...

Speaker

For example, 300 pixels like that.

Speaker

And then we also want some space above the card.

Speaker

of course, Martin

Speaker

Let the pressure 50 pixels down from the top.

Speaker

And finally, it should be centered, so...

Speaker

Let's do it, Marken.

Speaker

Left.

Speaker

Auto and margin.

Speaker

Right.

Speaker

Okay, so now we have something that looks at least a little bit like a card.

Speaker

there's one problem here.

Speaker

You can see the text is crammed all the way into the edges of the if, which doesn't look particularly good.

Speaker

And that is where

Speaker

comes into play.

Speaker

So now I'm just gonna apply the padding.

Speaker

We're doing potting.

Speaker

for example.

Speaker

Thank you, Wendy.

Speaker

Prickles like that.

Speaker

As you can see.

Speaker

That created a little bit of space

Speaker

basically some breathing room in between the text and the edge of our div container here.

Speaker

And if I do...

Speaker

50, you can see it's even more breathing room.

Speaker

So where's margin?

Speaker

add space on the

Speaker

outside of our div.

Speaker

card which we've selected here.

Speaker

Padding will

Speaker

add space on the inside.

Speaker

in between the

Speaker

content.

Speaker

and the edges of the container.

Speaker

So, margin kind of lives.

Speaker

up here.

Speaker

And down here.

Speaker

If we are to visualize this in our HTML.

Speaker

where padding lives on the inside.

Speaker

of our element.

Speaker

That is here.

Speaker

I'm here.

Speaker

And now you might wonder, well, why did I just write padding? First, for Martin, we're specifying each of the sides.

Speaker

And well, you can do exactly that on padding as well.

Speaker

This padding 20 pixels right here is the exact same thing as writing the following.

Speaker

Padding top 20, bottom 20, left 20, and right 20.

Speaker

So with these four lines, we

Speaker

We can actually delete this one up here.

Speaker

Then we have the same convention as we're using with Martis.

Speaker

It's just that you can use

Speaker

Adding 20 pixels like that.

Speaker

all of the values are the same.

Speaker

It's basically a shorthand.

Speaker

And now that we have all of them written out, we can play around a little bit with it, perhaps, Adi.

Speaker

100 pixels on the left hand side looks really weird and 100 pixels on the top as well.

Speaker

And suddenly our card does not look very good.

Speaker

Let's get it back.

Speaker

And now I want to give you a challenge.

Speaker

I want you to ask

Speaker

padding to make our card.

Speaker

look like the provided design.

Speaker

And the provided design is right here.

Speaker

You can see it's a completely broken card, as we've been ruthless about our padding.

Speaker

And I've actually removed all of the padding rules from the CSS as I want you to build some muscle memory writing padding.

Speaker

So go ahead and make this card look like it does in the slide.

Speaker

and then return back to me once you've done it.

Speaker

Okay, hopefully that went well. If not, no worries, let's do it together.

Speaker

As you can see here, it's completely crammed into the bottom left corner.

Speaker

Which means that it doesn't have...

Speaker

any padding on the left hand side or

Speaker

any padding on the bottom.

Speaker

But a ton of padding on the top.

Speaker

and a ton of padding on the right.

Speaker

So I'm just gonna do...

Speaker

100 pixels, something I got.

Speaker

Seems.

Speaker

Pretty much what we have in the design as well.

Speaker

and then do the same.

Speaker

cladding.

Speaker

And to me, that looks actually pretty much like our design.

Speaker

I don't need to write padding bottom or padding left now.

Speaker

Do I could do it? I could do it.

Speaker

Potting.

Speaker

- Autumn.

Speaker

0 pixels or just 0.

Speaker

I'm padding.

Speaker

Left.

Speaker

Zero, that's well.

Speaker

Go.

Speaker

That didn't change anything.

Speaker

So it's actually not needed because by default the padding of a

Speaker

is

Speaker

zero.

Speaker

So, however you solve this.

Speaker

Great job.

Speaker

Let's move on.

Speaker

So now you've learned about controlling the space on the outside of the element with the margin.

Speaker

on the inside of the element with the padding.

Speaker

Wouldn't it be nice if we could also control the border in between the margin and the padding?

Speaker

And it turns out we can.

Speaker

You guessed it.

Speaker

border property.

Speaker

How's everybody right there?

Speaker

and then specify, for example.

Speaker

Two pixels thickness solid in shape.

Speaker

and then color red.

Speaker

Good to see you.

Speaker

Then we get a border, which

Speaker

which is on the outside of the padding, but on the inside of the margin.

Speaker

if we change any of these through.

Speaker

values here.

Speaker

It'll update accordingly, so let's try.

Speaker

pixels with instead, you can see it's much thicker now.

Speaker

Instead of solid, we can do...

Speaker

Audit like that.

Speaker

Pretty weird.

Speaker

And instead of red, we can do.

Speaker

For example, FF.

Speaker

White in hex decimal.

Speaker

Or just right.

Speaker

White like that.

Speaker

or just blue, so it's a little bit clearer.

Speaker

Now there are many types of borders, but in 99.9% of the cases you want to use solid like that.

Speaker

And also very often.

Speaker

You'd want to soft knob in the

Speaker

these corners.

Speaker

And you can do that with the border.

Speaker

Adios property. An area specify a pixel value, for example. 30 pixels and boom, there you can see.

Speaker

We have it much softer corners.

Speaker

If it crank this up to...

Speaker

100.

Speaker

For a thousand, it stops at some point because then the edges have simply turned into half circles. So at some point, there's no use going any higher.

Speaker

No, this looks...

Speaker

- You hit it, Pat.

Speaker

So what I want you to do now is fix it up so that it looks...

Speaker

Like this.

Speaker

And I'm not going to give you any of the values I've used here just a little hint.

Speaker

I took an already existing color in our box and used it for the border.

Speaker

That's a common web design trick to

Speaker

reuse colors and not have too many different colors. So if you think this is pure black, mm-hmm, you are wrong.

Speaker

So go ahead and change the values.

Speaker

the border and border radius so that our example here matches the design I've provided in the slide.

Mic

I'm gonna fuck them, I suppose for now it's 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 like that.

Speaker

Be a hen.

Speaker

Hopefully that went well.

Speaker

So let's start with the border.

Speaker

Big pixels here.

Speaker

bit to thick for me, so let's try

Speaker

instead.

Speaker

Is that not just better? Yes.

Speaker

and the color.

Speaker

I gave you hint.

Speaker

was just the blackish color we have for our text.

Speaker

Like that.

Speaker

And the border radius is much smaller, let's try 10.

Speaker

It still looks a little bit rounder.

Speaker

So

Speaker

Yes, there I think we got it.

Speaker

Great job.

Speaker

Now.

Speaker

cool thing to do in order to inspect the margin.

Speaker

border padding and size of the element in general.

Speaker

is to open up the dev tools which can be done by right clicking on the nav bar here.

Speaker

and then clicking in spec and then this dev tools panel will open.

Speaker

Here, clicking on the "Select icon" on the left hand side.

Speaker

and then hovering over the...

Speaker

Element.

Speaker

Finally clicking at it.

Speaker

There you will see.

Speaker

We have selected the element in the elements tab.

Speaker

And under the styles tab, you can see the styling, we have applied

Speaker

using CSS.

Speaker

heard it can actually modify them if you want.

Speaker

But we're not going to do that right now.

Speaker

We're gonna scroll down.

Speaker

and verify that our margin border and padding are correct.

Speaker

So if I hover over the margin here, you can see up here in the minibrowser and it's marked in orange.

Speaker

And the values are provided down in the box here. If I move over to the border, you can see that border is now selected in the browser.

Speaker

And as indeed four pixels, as we coded up a minute ago.

Speaker

If I move over to the padding.

Speaker

You can see that is also indeed 20 on each side just as we want it to be. And finally, if I...

Speaker

over the center here.

Speaker

content is highlighted and the content of this div is just the text.

Speaker

And as you can see, it is 300 pixels wide.

Mic

(chuckles)

Speaker

just as we said it us so it's working us expected

Speaker

And the height is dictated by

Speaker

many lines of text are two sentences required.

Speaker

using this technique of inspecting an element.

Mic

Hey Siri, 30 minute timer, alarm.

Speaker

And its sizing properties like this is a really good way of debugging if something, for example, looks wrong.

Mic

30 minutes counting down.

Speaker

because it gives you an ability to verify if the numbers here match up with what you've tried to write in your CSS.

Speaker

So now that you've learned all of that.

Speaker

I want to tell you the name of this.

Speaker

It's actually cold.

Speaker

the box model.

Speaker

And to be honest, I've never really liked this word.

Speaker

It sounds more complex than the rest, in my opinion.

Speaker

It's just spacing around the element, a border,

Speaker

meeting on the inside of an element and the content itself. But in web development, we call this the box model.

Speaker

So you'll probably hear this name come up from time to time.

Speaker

But you shouldn't fair it. You know exactly what it is and you've used all of the properties in the box model. So don't worry about it. Actually, let's give you a new box model practice in the next script.

Speaker

I'll see you there.

Speaker

Okay, now you are going to create a really neat looking button.

Speaker

Namely, the following button on Twitter. Let's zoom in a little bit and here you can see it. This is the button you see if you already are following someone. And, we zoom out again. This is the Scrimbo Twitter profile.

Speaker

definitely just click this image and follow us because we share a

Speaker

of useful tips and tricks and career advice for aspiring coders here.

Speaker

So it's definitely worthwhile.

Speaker

Anyway, now you are going to use the things you've learned about

Speaker

adding.

Speaker

border, border radius, and so forth in order to make this button right here with the ugly default styling.

Speaker

Look exactly like this.

Speaker

Or not exactly?

Speaker

As we're not going to worry about the font, it is a little bit different, but other than that you should try to make it look identical.

Speaker

I've given you some hints here.

Speaker

For example, the border color is this hex color right here and the text color is this one right here. And also, you need to remember to adjust the font weight.

Speaker

And I don't think you've done that.

Speaker

Ever since the very first scrim, where you wrote your first lines of CSS?

Speaker

So you might have to look back.

Speaker

So, if you figure out how to adjust the font weight, or you can Google it up to you.

Speaker

Anyway, just go ahead and give this your best shot.

Speaker

And if you had some

Speaker

Okay, hopefully that went well, let's do it together.

Speaker

I'm going to target the button just using an element selector like this. And now let's pick the low hanging fruit.

Speaker

Namely, the ones we've gotten here already. For example, by doing color.

Speaker

and copying this.

Speaker

All the right here. Okay, that didn't change much. At least not visibly. Then let's do border.

Speaker

And I'm going to start with one pixel solid.

Speaker

and then the border color right here.

Speaker

So it looks a little bit different, though.

Speaker

but not quite.

Speaker

This.

Speaker

One thing we can clearly see is that this image has a white background.

Speaker

where ours is still a little bit great. So let's do that as well.

Speaker

Okay, yes.

Speaker

Arbucken is much more crammed. There's too little padding.

Speaker

We're as hairy, you can see we have a little bit of padding.

Speaker

top and the bottom and actually quite a lot of padding on the left and right hand side.

Speaker

And that's actually a little design tip right there.

Speaker

you often see is that buttons have more padding on the left hand side and the right hand side.

Speaker

they have a

Speaker

often below.

Speaker

Let's try.

Speaker

potting.

Speaker

Five pixels, for example, padding.

Speaker

bottom.

Speaker

five pixels and then we'll try.

Speaker

Left.

Speaker

10 pixels and...

Speaker

Right 10 pixels as well.

Speaker

How does that look?

Speaker

Not too bad, but actually it looks like this button has even more.

Speaker

So we've added.

Speaker

half as much on the top and bottom as we have on the sides. So let's crank up both of these a little bit.

Speaker

of these into

Speaker

top and below.

Speaker

and select both of these and do 16 left and right. Yeah, I think that's more like it.

Speaker

One thing that definitely is remaining is the round that edges here.

Speaker

So that is the border radius.

Speaker

I don't appear with the border.

Speaker

I can pick us.

Speaker

It's a little bit round now, but not as round as the Twitter button.

Speaker

So let's do

Speaker

16.

Speaker

word like it?

Speaker

Can we go higher?

Speaker

I think we can go to 18.

Speaker

That looks quite good to me.

Speaker

If we compare it to this one.

Speaker

And then finally, we needed to remember the font weight.

Speaker

Wait.

Speaker

That looks a lot better.

Speaker

I think the final adjustment.

Speaker

I want to make it is.

Speaker

adding even a little bit more padding around it.

Speaker

a bit more spacious.

Speaker

So here we are really in the Knit picking area.

Speaker

But let's try 10.

Speaker

on both of the carbon bottom, and let's try 20 on the left and right.

Speaker

And what's interesting now is that since the box now has grown in size, because it's affected by the padding, the border radius can also be cranked up a little bit.

Speaker

I think actually we can do 20 now.

Speaker

Yes, because the bigger the box is...

Speaker

More pixels you need to add in order to get this fully soft looking button.

Speaker

essentially has two half circles on each of its sides.

Speaker

Looking at the example?

Speaker

and comparing it with ours, I think we have reached our goal.

Speaker

And if your values are different than mine, that does not matter at all.

Speaker

actually creating the button of a huge public company here, you are just learning basic CSS, so it's totally not expected that you create buttons as neatly as Twitter does.

Speaker

as they probably have a team of developers and designers working just on this profile page.

Speaker

So, however it went, be proud of yourself and get ready to move on with our Google project.
