Speaker

We are back at our Google project and now you are going to fix the design of our search field.

Speaker

and you're actually gonna get a design spec and a proper walkthrough of how I want it to look.

Speaker

So here I've opened up the dev tools, actually on the right hand side, as I want to inspect the box model of the

Speaker

this element with you.

Speaker

And if you wonder how I managed to stick the tools to the right hand side here.

Speaker

Just click these three icons if you're in Chrome, then you can choose the Doc side.

Speaker

So let's move on down here to the box model of the input field. And if I hover over the content in the box model here, you can see that it says

Speaker

400 pixels times 24 pixels.

Mic

you

Speaker

And you can see the content is marked in blue.

Speaker

in the Mini Browser here.

Mic

you

Speaker

That means that our width is 400 pixels.

Speaker

We know that because we set it ourselves here and the height of the content should be 24 pixels. Okay, let's move on to the padding. By hover over that,

Mic

you

Speaker

You can see it's green and it's highlighted in green in the mini browser, the padding at the top and the bottom are...

Speaker

10 pixels as you can see down

Speaker

here and the left hand side and right hand side have

Speaker

30 pixels each.

Mic

you

Speaker

And then if we move over to the border, you can see that it's simply one pixel.

Speaker

all around.

Mic

you

Speaker

Here is your design spec given to you by your hipster designer down in the bottom right corner here.

Speaker

Is your desire is your desire all around if we and the bottom are?

Speaker

10 pixels, as you can see down here, and the left hand side and the right hand side have

Speaker

30 pixels each.

Mic

you

Speaker

And then if we move over to the border...

Speaker

You can see that it's simply one pixel.

Speaker

all around.

Mic

you

Speaker

Here is your design spec given to you. Bye.

Speaker

your hipster designer down in the bottom right corner here.

Speaker

Hide-of content 24 pixels.

Speaker

But do remember the Thaddis,

Speaker

actually the height of the inner box here.

Speaker

not the height of the total input field?

Speaker

as that all

Speaker

But the height property should be 24 pixels.

Speaker

The padding above and beyond are said to ten pixels.

Speaker

right on the left hand side, 30 pixels.

Speaker

thickness of border one pixel.

Speaker

color of border is this.

Speaker

And then finally also the border radius is also a value that our designer has been kind enough to give to you.

Speaker

Take this design spec and implement it using CSS.

Speaker

Okay, hopefully that went well. If not, no worries, we'll do this together right now.

Speaker

So starting with the height of 24. There I'm going to just write.

Speaker

24 pixels like that.

Speaker

So it became a little bit colder now. The next step is the binding top and bottom was 10 pixels.

Speaker

10px.

Speaker

Autumn was also NPX like that.

Speaker

The padding left and right hand side were 30 pixels.

Speaker

according to the spec.

Speaker

So let's implement that, like that.

Speaker

and then we'll move on to the border.

Speaker

One pixel and this hex code right here.

Speaker

So I'll do border and here we have to provide it with three values. So one.

Speaker

Pixel.

Speaker

It is going to be solid and the color is...

Speaker

D-F-E-1-E.

Speaker

That looking pretty good.

Speaker

The final thing then is the border radius.

Speaker

And that should be 24 pixels, according to the design.

Speaker

And look at this, it is starting to look very

Speaker

really professional.

Speaker

So really good job if you did this challenge. If you did a couple of mistakes, no worries at all.

Speaker

I also did a little mistake here, according to best practices, when setting heights for input fields.

Speaker

because actually...

Speaker

I'm going to show you that this height of 24 pixels here is actually not the way.

Speaker

We want to do it.

Speaker

Because if I Google,

Speaker

Set type of input field CSS and then click the first link.

Speaker

That is a Stack Overflow question.

Speaker

And here you can see someone who's been having problems with this, so they've asked a question about it. If we scroll a little bit down, you can see that people are saying,

Speaker

with padding.

Speaker

and Wine Height.

Speaker

line height, that's not something we've used.

Speaker

We scroll a little bit down, you can see that.

Speaker

Some browsers will honor a CSS high-true.

Speaker

some not, so it seems to be a little bit difficult to use height for the input field.

Speaker

And this person's wall suggests line height.

Speaker

And likewise with this third person here. So I'm going to trust the wisdom of the crowds here and use line height instead.

Speaker

Didn't change anything, but we are using a property that more browsers apparently will honor.

Speaker

and line height is actually just the height of

Speaker

one line of text.

Speaker

and says that is everything we have inside of an input field. It's just one line of text.

Speaker

That'll be the exact same thing for setting the height.

Speaker

of the inner content of the input field.

Speaker

So if that was a little bit confusing and you prefer to just use height, that's totally fine as well. It's more important that you are using what you are comfortable with and then that you are doing it the 100% correct way according to conventions. So just use whatever you want.

Speaker

I just wanted you to be aware the fact that this is the recommended way according to Stack Overflow.

Speaker

With that,

Speaker

Let's move on.

Speaker

Okay, we are back at our Google project and now you are going to fix the deal.

Speaker

Let's move on.

Speaker

Okay, we are back at our Google project and now you are going to fix the design of our search field.

Speaker

And you're actually gonna get a design spec and proper walkthrough of how I want it to look.

Speaker

So here I've opened up the

Speaker

Okay, now we're going to add the first button to our Google project.

Speaker

So I'm gonna head over to the HTML and here beneath the input field. I'm just gonna

Speaker

It's gonna type.

Speaker

button

Speaker

Like that.

Speaker

And this will be the...

Speaker

Google search button.

Speaker

So there we have it.

Speaker

Doesn't exactly look good, but don't worry about that.

Speaker

Now, I want to give this a class as well.

Speaker

a class named you'll often see used for buttons is simply B, D, and like that.

Speaker

Now that we have that,

Speaker

want you to center the button and add some space above it. So go ahead and use the class selector to select this button and solve this challenge. Good luck!

Speaker

Okay, so what I'll do is do dot vtn to select the button. Here you might have been tempted to simply do margin left auto.

Speaker

doesn't seem to do anything. Why is that? Well, if you remember the criteria you needed in order to use this technique to center elements.

Speaker

One of them was that you need your element to be display block.

Speaker

buttons are actually displayed in line by default.

Speaker

So if we do display.

Speaker

Ooh, there we go.

Speaker

The button is centered.

Speaker

And now you might ask, well, what about the width? We also set the width on the input field and the logo.

Speaker

But could do that as well with this one? Let's do with.

Speaker

200 pixels for example. However,

Speaker

not needed because if we remove the width you can see that it still has a width which is certainly not full width across the entire page so it kind of has an implicit width without us setting the width. So even though it is a criteria that your element needs a width in order to use this technique.

Speaker

technique here in order to center it, you don't necessarily have to set the width yourself if the element already has some kind of width. So it works perfectly fine just doing display block and margin left right auto in this example.

Speaker

Finally, we are going to add some space above it. So let's do that.

Speaker

I'll do a margin top.

Speaker

do for example 30 pixels. Yeah.

Speaker

Looking pretty good.

Speaker

Great job solving this challenge, let's move on.

Speaker

We are going to style the button in our Google project.

Speaker

Because as you can see this is our button currently looks but

Speaker

This is how we want it to look.

Speaker

So we gotta do a bunch of changes. However.

Speaker

There's one thing I want to change actually on this Google.com homepage. Because notice how low the contrast is between the background color of the button and the background color of the entire website. It's hardly possible to see that there's any difference. And that's not good because it reduces the accessibility of the site and makes it hard for people who are visually impaired to use it. And actually, to prove this, let's take these two colors, the light gray hair and the white.

Speaker

put them into a contrast checker online. For example, this one right here on userray.org.

Speaker

have this nice little contrast checker where you can paste in the foreground color and the background color and then get it.

Speaker

contrast ratio. And this F8F9FA hex color.

Speaker

Is it the one?

Speaker

that Google is using?

Speaker

And if we scroll a bit down, you'll see that Google indeed

Speaker

on this test.

Speaker

complete failure.

Speaker

The ratio is 1.05, though it should have been 4.5 or more.

Speaker

So what we will do instead is change the background from this to something like this.

Speaker

Here you can see it's much easier to see, but it is indeed a button.

Speaker

So even though the real background color is this one right here, we are going to use this one right here.

Speaker

So with that in mind, I want you to style the button according to the provided design you now have.

Speaker

the only info. Give you a start.

Speaker

These are the properties you are going to use.

Speaker

However, I'm not giving you the values of any of them because I want you to practice looking at an example and making your best guess as to what the values for the CSS properties should be, as that's how you'll work out in the real world when a designer, for example, gives you a design file. So go ahead and do this right now, and then I will show you the solution afterwards as well.

Speaker

Okay, let's do this.

Speaker

I'm going to bring up the example here, have it on the side so that we can see how it develops. And then start with the background color as we have the value for that one.

Speaker

down here.

Speaker

Round.

Speaker

I would try to see what is the most apparent difference between this button.

Speaker

This one right here.

Speaker

Well, the border is certainly different.

Speaker

This button does not have a border at all.

Speaker

this one has a border.

Speaker

So let's just remove it.

Speaker

None like that.

Speaker

Keep good.

Speaker

Now, we can see that the text is much more crammed into this box.

Speaker

then this one right here. So that is the padding.

Speaker

And also, you can notice that there's more padding on the left and right hand side than on the top and bottom.

Speaker

So I'm going to try to add, for example.

Speaker

Hiding.

Speaker

Five pixels.

Speaker

looks like this one here has more than five pixels because this space is still pretty cramped.

Speaker

I'm going to do it, for example.

Speaker

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Speaker

I think that is more like it.

Speaker

that on the bottom as well.

Speaker

On the sides, I'm just going to try the double.

Speaker

Six invicables.

Speaker

Right?

Speaker

16 pixels and you know what?

Speaker

I think...

Speaker

that button.

Speaker

And our button looks pretty similar in size.

Speaker

So next up is the border radius because you can see this one is totally rectangular, whereas this one has softer corners.

Speaker

So I'm gonna do.

Speaker

border.

Speaker

Radius.

Speaker

Something like four pixels. So that is pretty good.

Speaker

The final minor adjustments I'm going to make is reduce the font size ever so little from what is here.

Speaker

down to what it is here.

Speaker

minutes almost identical.

Speaker

But I happen to know that this one is indeed 14 pixels.

Speaker

So I'm gonna do it.

Speaker

on the size.

Speaker

like.

Speaker

And there we actually have the buttons, this one.

Speaker

And this one.

Speaker

Identical.

Speaker

Now if you chose any other values than the ones I've chosen, don't worry about it at all.

Speaker

The point was not for you to reach the exact same values as me, but just in the same range basically.

Speaker

So, regardless of how your example ended up, good job reaching this far, let's just keep up the pace and move on.

Speaker

Now we are going to add the second button to our Google project. This I'm feeling lucky button right here.

Speaker

And I wanted you to do that on your own first.

Speaker

So that's your challenge, add the next button, and do remember to give that button a BTM class so that it's styled as our search button.

Speaker

And once you've done that and executed the code,

Speaker

I want you to take a look in the mini browser and

Speaker

Ask yourself.

Speaker

Why aren't our buttons

Mic

you

Speaker

having as we want them to because as you'll see.

Speaker

There's something wrong with layout.

Speaker

at least when comparing it to this layout right here.

Speaker

Go ahead and do that right now and try to think of why our layout is wrong. Then I will do it as well when you return back to me and explain what's going on.

Mic

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Mic

[BLANK_AUDIO]

Speaker

Okay, let's do this. So I'm lazy, so I'm just gonna copy this one like that and write.

Speaker

Feeling...

Speaker

Lucky?

Speaker

Rem the cold.

Speaker

As you can see.

Speaker

The buttons are now stacked on top.

Speaker

top of each other.

Speaker

What we can do in order to figure out what's going on here is actually use the built-in dev tools in the browser, which you've seen a few times now.

Speaker

Let me show you this debug session using slides. I'm going to right click in the nav bar and then choose inspect.

Speaker

Open up the Elements tab.

Speaker

and then click on the selector icon here so that I can select this button by hovering over it.

Speaker

And then down in the Styles tab.

Speaker

I can scroll down until I see the box model for our button. And what you'll notice is that our button is taking up all the available space on the left hand side and the right hand side. And if we move down to the second button,

Speaker

You can see that that button is also doing that.

Speaker

That is because they are display block.

Speaker

Exactly this line right here.

Speaker

If you remember from previous lectures, display block kind of takes up all of the available space on the horizontal axis.

Speaker

So as we said earlier, display block stacks on top. We aren't able to get the layout we want if our buttons are display block. And then you might be tempted to do, well, let's just remove the display block.

Speaker

However,

Speaker

If we do, they will be on the same line, yes. They are now in line elements, but they will just be crammed all the way to the left-hand side.

Speaker

Because.

Speaker

Margin left right auto doesn't work.

Speaker

If you remember from the lecture about centering, you learned that

Speaker

display block and

Speaker

margin left right arrow works together in order to center something.

Speaker

You can't have just one of them.

Speaker

Which means that in order to go from this layout to this layout, we have to use a different technique for centering the elements.

Speaker

And there's actually two ways we could do this. There's the simple and inflexible way using text align. And then there's the slightly harder but super flexible way using Flexbox. And since you're going to use Flexbox several times throughout this course, I want you to get familiar with it right away. So in the next scrim, we're going to talk about Flexbox, but before we do that, I just want to show you the simple way as well so that you've seen it. Because as you might remember, from one of the very first scrims in this section, we used something called

Speaker

right or center.

Speaker

the text "line property"

Speaker

works on all inline elements, not just on text.

Speaker

So what we can do is

Speaker

remove the display block from our buttons.

Speaker

As you know...

Speaker

that turns them into inline elements, and they are

Speaker

to the left.

Speaker

And that's inline element only take up the available space they need according to their content.

Speaker

There is no available margin to use. So Auto here, which basically means take up whatever available margin there is.

Speaker

serve snow purpose.

Speaker

So we can remove both of these to as well. As you can see, it made no difference. And then we can move up to the main, the parent, through the text align.

Speaker

Center like that and boom.

Speaker

Both buttons are now centered. So here we have told the container the main element all in line elements inside of it should align to the center.

Speaker

So that was the EC but inflexible way of doing this. Let's instead of using this technique move on to do it how the pro-sto it using FlexBox.

Speaker

Flexbox is everywhere.

Speaker

Let's just have a look at Twitter for example. Here the menu on the left hand side is created with Flexbox, as with the Tweet Options menu, and the timeline itself.

Speaker

and guess what the trends for you and who to follow which created with? You guessed it, Flexbox. So this is something you need to learn.

Speaker

Let's imagine that you have a ecommerce website, which you can see here.

Speaker

that sells shoes, hoodies, and t-shirts. Well, then you'd probably have a navigation menu like this one, where users can click and then probably open up a submenu or something like that.

Speaker

As you can see, the items stack on top of each other. That is to be expected as these are devs and devs are displayed block. They want to take up all the available space in the width.

Speaker

And if you're wondering how I styled these, we can head over to the styles.css and just have a quick look at that. You can see I've aligned the text to the center inside of all the items.

Speaker

had my done that, would have been aligned to the left.

Speaker

Also, there's a border, as you can see. There's some padding on the inside, and there's some margin in between the elements.

Speaker

Now the question is...

Speaker

What if I instead of this vertical layout wanted a horizontal layout, which is more common for so-called navigation bars?

Speaker

So something that looks like this.

Speaker

This is where FlexBox comes to the rescue. And in order to turn this into a FlexBox layout, I would first have to wrap these three items in a container. Because the FlexBox layout always consists of a container and its direct children.

Speaker

Let's wrap it in a bit.

Speaker

And give this a class of...

Speaker

For example, nav-rapper like that.

Speaker

If I run this now, nothing happens because divs as you know are invisible unless you give them any styling or content.

Speaker

Let's head over to the Style Stop CSS.

Speaker

And now target the wrapper like that.

Speaker

In order to turn this into a flex box container, what I have to do is write

Speaker

display, flex and boom.

Speaker

Suddenly, we have forced our three divs into one row. Now this layout flows from left to right along the horizontal axis, and that is pretty significant, given that these items were displayed block by default.

Speaker

But flick's box as powerful as it is over-right stat, and forces them onto one line.

Speaker

However, we haven't got quite the layout we want yet.

Speaker

As you can see, it's centered, and there's also some space in between the items.

Speaker

Let's start with the centring because...

Speaker

Flexbox now has control over these items and can decide where along the main axis they should be positioned. So we can do justify column. That is a little bit of a weird name for a property, but that's just how it is.

Speaker

And then set that to...

Speaker

Center.

Speaker

Now all of the items are centered.

Speaker

And the final step is just to get some spacing in between these items. And that is done with our good old friend, Margin, through the margin left. Let's do 10 pixels. And let's add the same thing on the margin.

Speaker

Right.

Speaker

And there we have the layout we wanted.

Speaker

Now a final cool thing I want to show you is that

Speaker

We can do, for example, an air as well, and that'll push it all the way to the right hand side.

Speaker

At the beginning, or alternatively, the space dash around. That's pretty cool. Now we've distributed all the white space around the space.

Speaker

around each of the items. And another one is space between.

Speaker

Now all of the available space is between the items, so they're spread out like this.

Speaker

Now we are getting ahead of ourselves here. I just wanted to demonstrate this to show how powerful Flexbox is. What you are going to work with is the center here.

Speaker

So with that, let's return back to our Google phone.

Speaker

Okay, we are back at our Google project and now your job is to center these two buttons besides each other.

Speaker

Meaning.

Speaker

getting to this layout right here.

Speaker

And the way to do that is of course using.

Speaker

Flexbox, so you'll wrap the two buttons in a Flexbox div and then center them.

Speaker

And then also...

Speaker

I want you to give the Div a class of Btn-Rapper.

Speaker

So you'll need to modify both the HTML and

Speaker

and the CSS here.

Speaker

Now, before you start...

Speaker

I'm going to remove these three lines here because they are solely there in order to center our buttons using this display block and margin of dry auto technique.

Speaker

However, now we're going to use the Flexbox technique, and we don't want to use both techniques at the same time, because that'll just be confusing, as they will affect each other.

Speaker

I will remove these lines and now you're left with this left aligned layout here.

Speaker

So please take over here.

Speaker

Do this talent.

Speaker

And then return back to me when you've done it or when you feel you need some guidance.

Speaker

Okay, hopefully that went well. If not, no worries, we'll do it now together.

Speaker

So I'm going to start with this Flexbox dev.

Speaker

that we want in our HTML.

Speaker

It should wrap our book.

Speaker

and only our buttons.

Speaker

So we want to start it up here.

Speaker

class of

Speaker

[speaking in foreign language]

Speaker

My bubbles.

Speaker

And then...

Speaker

And the div down here.

Speaker

So now it is simply wrapping our truth.

Speaker

If I run this code,

Speaker

seemingly nothing has happened.

Speaker

under the hood, we have

Speaker

rapper, which we can.

Speaker

Target using BTN.

Speaker

- That's Rapper.

Speaker

And then we can do.

Speaker

display.

Speaker

Flex.

Speaker

Let's turn our div into a flex box.

Speaker

And now we can use the...

Speaker

Justify content.

Speaker

Center, like that.

Speaker

Thank you.

Speaker

Both our buttons are centered.

Speaker

However,

Speaker

They are totally...

Speaker

crammed into each other now.

Speaker

There's no margin in between them.

Speaker

So in order to fix that,

Speaker

want to add a little bit of margin left and right.

Speaker

to these buttons.

Speaker

I'm going to do it.

Speaker

Martin.

Speaker

Left.

Speaker

four pixels.

Speaker

Morgan.

Speaker

Right.

Speaker

or pixels as well.

Speaker

Like that.

Speaker

That's looking.

Speaker

Pretty good to me.

Speaker

So if you didn't do this no worries at all and also if you are a little bit confused

Speaker

Thanks for watching.

Speaker

That is totally okay as well, we're going to work with that.

Speaker

several times throughout this course, you'll get more opportunities to practice.

Speaker

This is this, just feel proud that you've at least dipped your toes into Flexbox.

Speaker

Super important tool for

Speaker

any front-end developer.

Speaker

Great job.

Speaker

Let's move on.

Speaker

Now there's one final thing I want you to know.

Speaker

And that is the...

Speaker

You are amazing.

Speaker

Because you have taken your very first step.

Speaker

into the world of CSS.

Speaker

That is more than

Speaker

and most people.

Speaker

So take this moment to feel great about yourself.

Speaker

And also, let's take this moment.

Speaker

to recap what you've learned.

Speaker

Starting out, you learned about the CSS syntax.

Speaker

That is how you select elements and also use properties and values.

Speaker

And then you learn the key concept about inline elements versus block elements.

Speaker

So block elements snacking on top of each other, like these two, and inline elements

Speaker

and then kind of in a horizontal line like the buttons here.

Speaker

Moving on, you learned about margins, which is how you create white space outside of elements. For example, above the Google logo here, and you learned about its close cousin, the padding, which is how you create space on the inside of elements. For example, in between the text and the edges of these buttons.

Mic

you

Mic

you

Speaker

Also borders is what is between padding and margins.

Mic

you

Speaker

And we use that on the input field here. We decided its thickness, its type, and color, and also the radius of the corners.

Speaker

We didn't want to sharp edges but rather soft.

Speaker

circular edges, which we achieved with this border radius property.

Speaker

But we also did was take a closer look at the dev tank, which is so briefly in the HTML section.

Mic

you

Speaker

This time around though, you actually created two divs, one to wrap the entire project and another to wrap the buttons. And we had to separate those from each other, so you had to learn about classes.

Speaker

That is the attribute you set like this.

Speaker

and you select.

Speaker

by using the dot notation in CSS.

Mic

you

Mic

you

Speaker

Also a big thing is centering in CSS you learned through

Speaker

We need different ways of doing this.

Speaker

And the final way you centered elements was through the use of

Speaker

Flexbox is super powerful too.

Speaker

all front and developers need to be comfortable with.

Speaker

So

Mic

you

Speaker

you have learned.

Speaker

lot.

Speaker

Now, I think you should take a little break?

Speaker

you have to digest these things, recharge, and then I will see you back here when you are ready.

Speaker

in the next section.

Speaker

Hi there, this is Pera from Screenbar. Just take quick pause in your learning, as I wanted to tell you about our screen bastards.
